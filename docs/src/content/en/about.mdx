### Contributions to the Documentation Are Welcome

The SAuthBase documentation is an open reference that both users and developers can improve together.

You may discover unclear expressions or questions that developers might overlook, especially if you're using the SDK for the first time. Any contributions are welcome, from typo corrections to adding concrete examples or clarifying explanations.

Please feel free to suggest improvements via Issues or Pull Requests on GitHub.

## Development History

- **March 2024**  
  The initial authentication support package, `Scratch Auth React`, was developed by Toa Kiryu. It offered React-based UI components and authentication processes. However, due to changes in Scratch's specifications, the system became unstable, leading to the need for fundamental improvements.

- **October 2024**  
  As an improved version, Toa Kiryu released `Scratch Auth with Next.js`. The entire code structure and UI were redesigned using a modern architecture, but development became difficult and was eventually discontinued.

- **January 2025**  
  A third project, `scratch-auth-component`, was planned by Toa Kiryu. Some design and development were initiated but eventually forgotten and paused.

- **May 2025**  
  Toa Kiryu founded a new organization, **ScratchCore**, to promote the development of Scratch-related technologies. As its first official project, the development of `Scratch Auth Base SDK (SAuthBase)` began. It aims to be a robust and extensible authentication SDK, leveraging past learnings.

## Future Plans

- Add SDK extensions such as token storage and re-authentication
- Support for other frameworks like Vue and Svelte
- Expand applicability beyond Scratch-related services
