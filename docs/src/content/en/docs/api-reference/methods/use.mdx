# use

Type: `use(): sauthbase`

The `use()` method is a static function used to retrieve the initialized `sauthbase` instance.

If it is called before the instance is initialized using `sauthbase.init()`, an exception will be thrown.

---

## Example Usage

```ts filename="TypeScript" showLineNumbers twoslash
// @noErrors
import { sauthbase } from "sauthbase";

const sab = sauthbase.use();
console.log(sab); // Displays the sauthbase instance
```

---

## Return Value

- The `sauthbase` instance

---

## Notes

- This method throws `Error: SAuthBase has not been initialized.` if called before `sauthbase.init()` has been executed.
- It is a useful utility for reusing or globally accessing the instance.
