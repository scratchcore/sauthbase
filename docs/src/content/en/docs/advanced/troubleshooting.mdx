# Troubleshooting

This page lists common issues when using SAuthBase, along with solutions and a complete reference of all response codes (`code`).

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### `SAuthBase has not been initialized.`

- **Cause**: `sauthbase.use()` was called before `sauthbase.init()`.
- **Solution**: Call `sauthbase.init()` during app startup before using `.use()`.

### `Invalid token format.`

- **Cause**: The token passed to `decrypt()` or `extractUserWithVerify()` does not follow the `iv:encrypted:authTag` format.
- **Solution**: Ensure the token is correctly generated and check your encryption process.
