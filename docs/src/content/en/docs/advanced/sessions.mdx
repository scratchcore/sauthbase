# Session Management

SAuthBase issues a session after user authentication, enabling access to user information without requiring re-authentication. This page explains how session handling works in detail.

## How Sessions Work

When `verifySession()` completes successfully, a `token` is generated and returned to the client along with the verification result.

```json filename="Example: Response on successful authentication" showLineNumbers
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "token": "*************************************",
    "payload": {
      "valid": true,
      "username": "***********",
      "type": "instant",
      "redirect": "http://localhost:3000/auth"
    }
  }
}
```

This `token` should be securely stored on the client side (e.g., in cookies or localStorage) and used in subsequent requests instead of re-authentication.

## Verification and Decryption

The session ID stored on the client is verified and decrypted using the `extractUserWithVerify` function.

```ts filename="Example: Session verification" showLineNumbers twoslash
// @noErrors
import { sauthbase } from "sauthbase"

const sab = sauthbase.use();
const result = await sab.extractUserWithVerify(sessionId);
```

This function detects any tampering of the session ID and returns an error if it is invalid.

## Notes

- Store user session tokens securely to prevent leaks.
- Avoid sending the session token with every requestâ€”only send it when necessary.
- `extractUserUnsafe` is lightweight but performs no verification, so `extractUserWithVerify` is recommended for secure processing.
